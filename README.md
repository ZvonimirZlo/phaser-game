## About The App
Codecademy practice project. Simple memory game build in Html/Css/Javascript with Phaser.js.
The game draws inspiration from a game used to study chimpanzee memory. 
The premise of the game is that numbers flash on the screen for a brief period of time before being covered by circles. 
The goal is to then click on the circles in the correct order from smallest to largest.
